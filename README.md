# Tetris

**Goal**: Implement a variant of Tetris, a game invented by Alexey Pazhitnov at the Moscow Academy of Science

The game of Tetris consists of a 2D grid and a stream of various-shaped pieces that fall, one at a time, onto the
grid. The goal of the game is to rotate and move the pieces, so that as they fall, they are tightly packed and form entire
rows. Once entire an row is formed, the row collapses, providing room for additional pieces to fall, thereby allowing
the player to move and place additional pieces. The rest of the game is best described by playing it. There are many
variations of Tetris, but we will be using the version available at the following site as our definition of correctness:

We will be implementing the Super Rotation System for rotations and wall kicks, which can be found here:
